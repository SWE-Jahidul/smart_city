                                    <p class="card-text">A knockout tournament or elimination tournament is divided
                                        into successive rounds; each competitor plays in at least one fixture per
                                        round. The top-ranked competitors in each fixture progress to the next
                                        round. As rounds progress, the number of competitors and fixtures decreases.
                                        The final round, usually known as the final or cup final, consists of just
                                        one fixture; the winner of which is the overall champion.

                                        In a single-elimination tournament, only the top-ranked competitors in a
                                        fixture progress; in 2-competitor games, only the winner progresses. All
                                        other competitors are eliminated. This ensures a winner is decided with the
                                        minimum number of fixtures. However, most competitors will be eliminated
                                        after relatively few matches; a single bad or unlucky performance can
                                        nullify many preceding excellent ones.

                                        A double-elimination tournament may be used in 2-competitor games to allow
                                        each competitor a single loss without being eliminated from the tournament.
                                        All losers from the main bracket enter a losers’ bracket, the winner of
                                        which plays off against the main bracket’s winner.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">The marathon is a long-distance running event with an official
                                        distance of 42.195 kilometres (26 miles and 385 yards), usually run as a road
                                        race.
                                        The event was instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the Greek soldier
                                        Pheidippides, a messenger from the Battle of Marathon to Athens.

                                        The marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896, though the
                                        distance did not become standardized until 1921. More than 500 marathons are
                                        held
                                        throughout the world each year, with the vast majority of competitors being
                                        recreational athletes as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of
                                        participants.</p>

                                        In a single-elimination tournament, only the top-ranked competitors in a
                                        fixture progress; in 2-competitor games, only the winner progresses. All
                                        other competitors are eliminated. This ensures a winner is decided with the
                                        minimum number of fixtures. However, most competitors will be eliminated
                                        after relatively few matches; a single bad or unlucky performance can
                                        nullify many preceding excellent ones.

                                        A double-elimination tournament may be used in 2-competitor games to allow
                                        each competitor a single loss without being eliminated from the tournament.
                                        All losers from the main bracket enter a losers’ bracket, the winner of
                                        which plays off against the main bracket’s winner.</p>

                                        successive rounds; each competitor plays in at least one fixture per round. The
                                        top-ranked competitors in each fixture progress to the next round. As rounds
                                        progress, the number of competitors and fixtures decreases. The final round,
                                        usually
                                        known as the final or cup final, consists of just one fixture; the winner of
                                        which
                                        is the overall champion. In a single-elimination tournament, only the top-ranked
                                        competitors in a fixture progress; in 2-competitor games, only the winner
                                        progresses. All other competitors are eliminated. This ensures a winner is
                                        decided
                                        with the minimum number of fixtures. However, most competitors will be
                                        eliminated
                                        after relatively few matches; a single bad or unlucky performance can nullify

                                        winner of which plays off against the main bracket’s winner.</p>
